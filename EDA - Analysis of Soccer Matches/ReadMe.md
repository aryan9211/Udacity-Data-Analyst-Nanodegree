The aim of the project is to analyse the European Soccer Dataset (available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/home) containing results of matches played from 2008 to 2016 across the major european leagues and answering the following questions:

 - How is the amount of goal scored distributed? How is it evolving?

 - In which leagues are matches most likely to end up with three or more goal?

 - Which teams have scored the most?

 - Has european football become more or less equilibrated?

 - Which are the most equilibrated leagues?

 - Is there any evidence of home advantage?

As a measure of competitiveness it has been chosen the difference of the goals scored by the two teams. If the such difference is low, the match is assumed to be more equilibrated. Hence, if a league shows a low goal difference for each match, it is assumed to be more equilibrated and unpredictable.

The final question is aimed to show if during the seasons from 2008 and 2016 it has been a substantial home advantage. The home advantage is defined as the benefit that the home team is said to gain over the visiting team (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage) and it may be due to many different factors that we are not takining into consideration in this analysis. The main goal here is to find ou whether or not there had been evidence of home advantage during the perion under analysis.
